# üìã Project Summary: Multi-Company Truck Management System

## üéØ Project Overview

A comprehensive Django-based backend system designed for managing truck fleets across multiple companies with complete data isolation, role-based access control, and JWT authentication. The system provides a scalable solution for logistics companies to manage their drivers, trucks, destinations, and delivery tasks independently while maintaining security and data integrity.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Design

- **Single Database, Multiple Tenants**: One PostgreSQL database with company-based data separation
- **ForeignKey Relationships**: All core entities linked to Company model for isolation
- **Unique Constraints**: Company-scoped uniqueness (license numbers, plate numbers)
- **CASCADE Deletion**: Proper cleanup when companies related entities are removed

### User Role System

- **Superuser**: Full system access, can manage all companies
- **Company Admin**: Manages only assigned company's data with full CRUD permissions
- **Driver User**: Read-only access to assigned tasks, cannot modify data

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend Stack

- **Framework**: Django 5.2
- **API**: Django REST Framework with JWT authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper indexing and constraints
- **Authentication**: SimpleJWT for secure token-based API access
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI integration with drf-yasg

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Company Management**: Complete CRUD operations for company entities
2. **Driver Management**: Track experience, status, and company assignment
3. **Truck Fleet Management**: Monitor capacity, fuel type, and availability
4. **Destination Management**: Store delivery locations with coordinates
5. **Task Assignment**: Link drivers, trucks, and destinations for deliveries
6. **Route Optimization**: API-ready integration for Google/Yandex Maps

## üìä Database Schema

### Core Models

```
Company
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CompanyAdmin (OneToOne with User)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DriverUser (OneToOne with User -> Driver)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Driver (ForeignKey to Company)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Truck (ForeignKey to Company)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Destination (ForeignKey to Company)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DeliveryTask (ForeignKey to Company, Driver, Truck)
```

### Data Integrity

- **Unique Constraints**: `(company, license_number)` for drivers, `(company, plate_number)` for trucks
- **Foreign Key Cascades**: Proper deletion handling when parent entities are removed
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation in serializers and models

## üîê Security & Permissions

### Authentication System

- **JWT Tokens**: Access and refresh token implementation
- **Token Expiration**: Configurable token lifetime
- **Secure Endpoints**: All API endpoints require authentication

### Authorization Levels

- **Superuser**: Unrestricted access to all data
- **Company Admin**:
  - Full CRUD on company's drivers, trucks, destinations, tasks
  - Cannot access other companies' data
  - Admin panel access limited to company scope
- **Driver User**:
  - Read-only access to assigned tasks
  - Cannot create or modify any data
  - Company-scoped data visibility

### Data Isolation

- **Query Filtering**: All API queries automatically filtered by user's company
- **Admin Scoping**: Django admin interface respects company boundaries
- **Serializer Validation**: Company context enforced during data creation

## üöÄ API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/token/` - Obtain JWT access token
- `POST /api/auth/token/refresh/` - Refresh expired tokens

### Core Resources

- `GET/POST /api/companies/` - Company management (admin only)
- `GET/POST /api/drivers/` - Driver CRUD with company scoping
- `GET/POST /api/trucks/` - Truck fleet management
- `GET/POST /api/destinations/` - Delivery location management
- `GET/POST /api/delivery-tasks/` - Task assignment and tracking

### Specialized Endpoints

- `GET /api/drivers/available/` - Available drivers only
- `GET /api/trucks/available/` - Available trucks only
- `GET /api/delivery-tasks/active/` - Active tasks only
- `POST /api/delivery-tasks/assign/` - Streamlined task assignment
- `POST /api/delivery-tasks/{id}/start/` - Start task execution
- `POST /api/delivery-tasks/{id}/complete/` - Mark task as completed

## üó∫Ô∏è Maps Integration Ready

### Prepared APIs

- **Route Calculation**: Google Maps and Yandex Maps integration
- **Route Optimization**: Multi-destination optimization algorithms
- **Geocoding**: Address to coordinate conversion
- **Reverse Geocoding**: Coordinate to address lookup

### Implementation Status

- API endpoints defined for maps integration
- Utility functions prepared for external API calls
- Ready for production API key configuration

## üìà Sample Data & Testing

### Test Companies

1. **Acme Logistics**: 2 drivers, 2 trucks, 3 destinations, 1 delivery task
2. **Bolt Transport**: 2 drivers, 2 trucks, 2 destinations, 1 delivery task

### Test Users

- **Company Admins**: `acme_admin`, `bolt_admin` (password: `admin123`)
- **Driver Users**: `driver1` through `driver4` (password: `driver123`)

### Data Relationships

- Each company has independent driver and truck fleets
- Destinations are company-specific
- Delivery tasks link company resources together
- Complete data isolation between companies

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Deployment

### Development Setup

- **Environment Configuration**: `.env` file for database settings
- **Database Migration**: Clean migration system with proper defaults
- **Sample Data**: Automated population command for testing
- **Admin Interface**: Full Django admin with company scoping

### Production Considerations

- **Security**: Environment variables for sensitive data
- **Performance**: Database indexing and query optimization
- **Scalability**: Multi-tenant architecture supports growth
- **Monitoring**: Django logging and error handling

### API Documentation

- **Swagger UI**: Interactive API documentation at `/api/docs/`
- **OpenAPI Schema**: Machine-readable API specification
- **Authentication Examples**: JWT token usage demonstrations

## üéØ Business Value
